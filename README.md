# Introduction
This project is the collection of my dot files. These can be used to sync up the bash environment across multiple systems. 

- For ubuntu (Linux):
  Run `setup.sh` 
- For windows (powershell):
  Run `.\setup_powershell_omp.ps1`

# Notes
`secret.sh` is not the part of the project, which preserves the secret environment varibles.
